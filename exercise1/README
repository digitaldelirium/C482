Programming Exercise One: Creating an Abstract Superclass and Concrete Subclass
 
The following exercise will test your knowledge of public, default, final, and abstract classes. Create an abstract superclass named Fruit and a concrete subclass named Apple. The superclass should belong to a package called food and the subclass can belong to the default package (meaning it isn't put into a package explicitly). Make the superclass public and give the subclass default access.
1. Create the superclass as follows:
2. 
3.   package food;
  public abstract class Fruit{ /* any code you want */}
1. Create the subclass in a separate file as follows:
2. 
3.   import food.Fruit;
  class Apple extends Fruit{ /* any code you want */}
1. Create a directory called food off the directory in your class path setting.
2. Attempt to compile the two files. If you want to use the Apple class, make sure you place the Fruit.class file in the food subdirectory.
