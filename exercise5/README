Programming Exercise Five: Creating a Labeled while Loop
 
Try creating a labeled while loop. Make the label outer and provide a condition to check whether a variable age is less than or equal to 21. Within the loop, increment age by one. Every time the program goes through the loop, check whether age is 16. If it is, print the message "get your driver's license" and continue to the outer loop. If not, print "Another year."
• The outer label should appear just before the while loop begins.
• Make sure age is declared outside of the while loop.
