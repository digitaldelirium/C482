Programming Exercise Four: Creating a switch-case Statement
 
Try creating a switch statement using a char value as the case. Include a default behavior if none of the char values match.
• Make sure a char variable is declared before the switch statement.
• Each case statement should be followed by a break.
• The default case can be located at the end, middle, or top.
